## [1.1.4] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Clicking a post did nothing** — status cards are now clickable. Clicking anywhere on the card body (not on a button or link) navigates to the status permalink page where you can read the full thread and comments.
- **Reply button did nothing** — clicking 💬 now opens the compose modal with `in_reply_to_id` pre-filled, a "Replying to @acct" label in the modal header, and the textarea pre-filled with the `@mention`. Modal close clears the reply state.
- **Repost and favourite errors were invisible** — if the API call failed, the button toggled but nothing happened. Errors now surface via alert and the button toggle is reversed so UI stays consistent with server state.
- **Repost count showed wrong value** — corrected to read `reblog.reblogs_count` on boost (server returns boost wrapper) and `reblogs_count` directly on unboost (server returns original).

### Changed
- Compose textarea resized to 500 × 50 px (initial height 50 px, resizable vertically).

## [1.1.3] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Posts appeared "5 hours ago" immediately after creation** — two root causes, both fixed:
  1. No `date_default_timezone_set()` in `bootstrap.php` — PHP inherited the server's system timezone (UTC-5/Eastern). `strtotime()` misread UTC values from the database as local time, and `date('c')` emitted local-time ISO 8601 strings that Mastodon clients parsed as 5 hours stale.
  2. No `SET time_zone` on the PDO connection — MariaDB's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` used the server's local timezone, storing `created_at` 5 hours behind UTC.
  - `bootstrap.php`: added `date_default_timezone_set('UTC')` — all PHP date/`strtotime()` calls now operate in UTC.
  - `Database.php`: added `SET time_zone = '+00:00'` on every new PDO connection — `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` always returns UTC regardless of server configuration.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Worker crashed on every delivery before migration 006 was applied** — `PDOException` extends `RuntimeException` in PHP. The catch-block meant to silently ignore a missing `delivery_failures` column was structured as `catch (RuntimeException) { throw $e }` followed by `catch (Throwable)`. Because `PDOException` is a `RuntimeException`, the DB error was caught and re-thrown, crashing every `DeliverActivity` job with *Unknown column 'delivery_failures'* before any HTTP request was made. Restructured the back-off check to collect the back-off signal as a flag outside the try block so `catch(\Throwable)` exclusively handles DB errors.

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Followers-only posts not federated** — posts with `private` (followers-only) visibility were never delivered to remote followers. Only `public` and `unlisted` passed the visibility guard in the post handler.
- **Unlisted posts had wrong ActivityPub addressing** — unlisted posts are now correctly addressed `to: [followers], cc: [Public]` per the Mastodon convention, making them discoverable in remote federated timelines without appearing in the public firehose. Previously `cc` was empty, causing unlisted posts to be invisible on many remote servers.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-26

Six federation health improvements modelled on patterns from Mastodon's source:

### Added
- **Object dereferencing** — `handleCreate` now fetches the full post from the remote server when the activity delivers only a bare URI string as the object (some servers send stub-style activities). Previously those posts were silently dropped.
- **Relevance guard** — incoming `Create` and `Announce` activities are now filtered before being stored. A post is only saved if the remote actor is followed by a local user, the post addresses/mentions a local user, it replies to a local user's post, or it arrives from a subscribed relay. Relay-pushed content is always accepted. This prevents unbounded DB growth from unsolicited federation traffic.
- **30-day age window** — remote posts older than 30 days are not stored. They won't appear in any timeline and only consume space.
- **Tombstones** (migration `006_inbox_safety.sql`) — when a `Delete` activity arrives for a URI that is not locally known, a tombstone record is written. If a `Create` or `Announce` for that same URI arrives later (Delete beat Create in network ordering), it is silently discarded. Tombstones are pruned after 7 days by the nightly pruner.
- **Delivery failure tracking** (migration `006_inbox_safety.sql`) — the worker now records success/failure counts per remote domain in the `instances` table. After 10 consecutive failures, deliveries to that domain are skipped for 1 hour (back-off). Successful delivery resets the counter. This prevents the queue from flooding with retries to dead servers.
- **Boost deduplication in timelines** — if the same original post is boosted multiple times within a single timeline fetch, only the most-recent boost is shown. Prevents a single popular post from filling the entire Explore or home feed.

### Changed
- `handleAnnounce` now also accepts `Article`, `Page`, and `Question` object types (in addition to `Note`) when fetching the original post — consistent with Mastodon's behaviour.
- Mention notifications are now fired for all local users in the `to`/`cc` audience of an incoming Create, not only for the parent post's author.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Public/Explore timeline now includes boosts — previously `reblog_of_id IS NULL` silently hid all boosted posts from both the web Explore page and the Mastodon API federated timeline (`GET /api/v1/timelines/public`). Relay-pushed content arrives as Announce activities, so hiding boosts was hiding the majority of relay content. The web renderer already showed "🔄 X boosted" correctly; the filter was just suppressing the rows before they reached the renderer.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Boosts (Announce) were not federating** — boosting a post never sent an ActivityPub Announce activity to remote followers or to the original post's server
- **Unboost was not federating** — removing a boost never sent an Undo Announce activity
- **Duplicate boost on re-click** — missing `return` after idempotency check in `reblog()` caused a second boost row to be created silently on every re-click
- **Incoming remote boosts not shown in timeline** — `handleAnnounce` only incremented the reblogs count but never created a boost status row, so followed accounts' boosts never appeared in the home feed
- **Incoming Undo Announce not handled** — un-boosting from a remote server was silently ignored; now removes the boost row and decrements the count

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Search result people cards now link to the local `/@user@domain` profile page instead of the remote instance URL, so users can follow remote accounts without leaving the instance
- Search UI redesigned: replaced all inline styles with design-token CSS classes for consistent theming, dark-mode support, and hover states

### Added
- Section labels with result counts on search results page
- Post cards in search results with author avatar, handle, date permalink, and hover highlight
- Polished empty-state and search-hints panels
